This course will cover the basics of modern deep neural networks. The first part of the course will introduce function approximation, neural network architectures, activation functions, and operations. It will present different loss functions and describe how training is performed via backpropagation. In the second part, the course will describe specific types of neural networks, e.g. convolutional, recurrent, and transformers, as well as their applications in computer vision and natural language processing. The course will also briefly discuss foundation models, self-supervised and deep reinforcement learning, and generation approaches.
