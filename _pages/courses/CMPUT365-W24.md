For this course we will be use Coursera as the main platform for the course. You will need to sign up for the course on Coursera and complete the assignments and quizzes there. The course will be split into three courera courses, each with its own modules, a set of assignments, and a set of quizzes. The assignments and quizzes will be completed on Coursera. 

You need to make sure you sign up for the private version of the course that corresponds to this session and not the public version of the course. Any work done on the public version of the course will not be transferred to the private version of the course. Please check with the instructor or TAs if you are unsure if you are on the correct version of the course.

Coursera Courses:

1. [Funamentals of Reinforcement Learning](https://coursera.org/learn/fundamentals-of-reinforcement-learning)
2. Sample-based Learning Methods 
3. Prediction and Control with Function Approximation
