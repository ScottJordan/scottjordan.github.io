I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Alberta, co-advised by Professors [Martha White](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/) and [Adam White](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amw8/). I completed my Ph.D. in 2022 at the University of Massachusetts, where I was advised by Professor [Philip Thomas](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pthomas/). I primarily research techniques for solving sequential decision-making problems focusing on using Reinforcement Learning techniques. My research interests center around answering the following high-level questions: 
1. What are the necessary properties for scaling reinforcement learning techniques to solve many tasks? 
2. How can we make algorithms reliable and easy to use for non-experts, i.e., how can we make reinforcement learning algorithms work off-the-shelf?
3. What principles should we, as researchers, follow when designing machine learning experiments? Similarly, how can we improve the quality of experiments in machine learning?
