I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Alberta advised by Professor [Martha White](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/). I completed my Ph.D. in 2022 at the University of Massachusetts, where I was advised by [Professor Philip Thomas](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pthomas/). I primarily research techniques for solving sequential decision-making problems focusing on using Reinforcement Learning techniques. My research interests centers around three areas: 
1. Designing experimental methodologies that are more reliable and informative than those found in standard machine learning experiments, 
2. understanding the necessary properties for scaling reinforcement learning techniques to solve many tasks, 
3. developing scalable optimization methods for performing on-device learning.
