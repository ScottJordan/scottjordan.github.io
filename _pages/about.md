I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Alberta advised by Professor [Martha White](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/). I completed my Ph.D. in 2022 at the University of Massachusetts, where I was advised by [Professor Philip Thomas](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pthomas/). I primarily research techniques for solving sequential decision-making problems focusing on using Reinforcement Learning techniques. My research interests centers around three areas: 
1. Designing experimental methodologies that are more reliable and informative than those found in standard machine learning experiments, 
2. understanding the necessary properties for scaling reinforcement learning techniques to solve many tasks, 
3. developing scalable optimization methods for performing on-device learning. 



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
