I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Pittsburgh. I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Alberta, co-advised by Professors [Martha White](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/) and [Adam White](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amw8/). I completed my Ph.D. in 2022 at the University of Massachusetts, where I was advised by Professor [Philip Thomas](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pthomas/). I primarily research techniques for solving sequential decision-making problems, focusing on using Reinforcement Learning techniques. My research interests center around answering the following high-level questions: 
1. What are the necessary properties for scaling reinforcement learning techniques to solve many subtasks? 
2. How can we make algorithms reliable and easy to use for non-experts, i.e., how can we make reinforcement learning algorithms work off the shelf?
3. What principles should we, as researchers, follow when designing machine learning experiments? Similarly, how can we improve the quality of experiments in machine learning?

If you are interested in my research or collaborating, please reach out to me via email.
