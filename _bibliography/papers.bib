Specifically, we study the setting in which some set of MDPs is accessible for training. The goal is to generalize safely to MDPs that are sampled from the same distribution, but which may not be in the set accessible for training. For various definitions of safety, our algorithms give probabilistic guarantees that agents can safely generalize to MDPs that are sampled from the same distribution but are not necessarily in the training set. These algorithms are a type of Seldonian algorithm (Thomas et al., 2019), which is a class of machine learning algorithms that return models with probabilistic safety guarantees for user-specified definitions of safety.},

Taking a step towards ensuring that reported results are consistent, we propose a new comprehensive evaluation methodology for reinforcement learning algorithms that produces reliable measurements of performance both on a single environment and when aggregated across environments. We demonstrate this method by evaluating a broad class of reinforcement learning algorithms on standard benchmark tasks. },

While several works in the past have proposed methods that are safe for deployment, they assume that the underlying problem is stationary. However, many real-world problems of interest exhibit non-stationarity, and when stakes are high, the cost associated with a false stationarity assumption may be unacceptable. We take the first steps towards ensuring safety, with high confidence, for smoothly-varying non-stationary decision problems. Our proposed method extends a type of safe algorithm, called a Seldonian algorithm, through a synthesis of model-free reinforcement learning with time-series analysis. Safety is ensured using sequential hypothesis testing of a policyâ€™s forecasted performance, and confidence intervals are obtained using wild bootstrap.},

These representations improve generalization over large, finite action sets by allowing the agent to infer the outcomes of actions similar to actions already taken. We provide an algorithm to both learn and use action representations and provide conditions for its convergence. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated on large-scale real-world problems. },

  abstract = {Near-infrared diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is increasingly used to study relative changes in skeletal muscle blood flow. However, most diffuse correlation spectrometers assume that tissue optical properties-such as absorption ($\mu_a$) and reduced scattering ($\mu_s'$) coefficients-remain constant during physiological provocations, which is untrue for skeletal muscle. Here, we interrogate how changes in tissue $\mu_a$ and $\mu_s'$ affect DCS calculations of blood flow index (BFI). We recalculated BFI using raw autocorrelation curves and $\mu_a/\mu_s'$ values recorded during a reactive hyperemia protocol in 16 healthy young individuals. First, we show that incorrectly assuming baseline $\mu_a$ and $\mu_s'$ substantially affects peak BFI and BFI slope when expressed in absolute terms (cm2/s, P < 0.01), but these differences are abolished when expressed in relative terms ($\%$ baseline). Next, to evaluate the impact of physiologic changes in $\mu_a$ and $\mu_s'$, we compared peak BFI and BFI slope when $\mu_a$ and $\mu_s'$ were held constant throughout the reactive hyperemia protocol versus integrated from a 3-s rolling average. Regardless of approach, group means for peak BFI and BFI slope did not differ. Group means for peak BFI and BFI slope were also similar following ad absurdum analyses, where we simulated supraphysiologic changes in $\mu_a/\mu_s'$. In both cases, however, we identified individual cases where peak BFI and BFI slope were indeed affected, with this result being driven by relative changes in $\mu_a$ over $\mu_s'$. Overall, these results provide support for past reports in which $\mu_a/\mu_s'$ were held constant but also advocate for real-time incorporation of $\mu_a$ and $\mu_s'$ moving forward. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We investigated how changes in tissue optical properties affect near-infrared diffuse correlation spectroscopy (NIR-DCS)-derived indices of skeletal muscle blood flow (BFI) during physiological provocation. Although accounting for changes in tissue optical properties has little impact on BFI on a group level, individual BFI calculations are indeed impacted by changes in tissue optical properties. NIR-DCS calculations of BFI should therefore account for real-time, physiologically induced changes in tissue optical properties whenever possible. },

One reason is that results are commonly only reported using well-tuned models, and thus represent an optimistic evaluation of performance. In this work, we propose a new framework for evaluating algorithms that presents both the performance when the system is well-tuned, as well as the difficulty of tuning the algorithm. This is achieved by considering the distribution of performances that result when applying the method with different hyper-parameter settings (e.g., different step sizes and network structures). Using common benchmark tasks in supervised and reinforcement learning, we demonstrate how this evaluation framework can both evaluate an algorithmâ€™s robustness to hyper-parameter selection and identify new areas of improvement.}

We illustrate the approach by torquing a bolt with the Robonaut-2 humanoid robot using a handheld ratchet. The difficulties include the uncertainty of the ratchet pose after grasping and the high precision required for mating the socket to the bolt and replacing the tool in the tool holder. Our approach learns the desired relative position between visual features on the ratchet and the bolt. It does this by identifying goal offsets from visual features that are consistently observable over a set of demonstrations. With this approach we show that Robonaut-2 is capable of grasping the ratchet, tightening a bolt, and putting the ratchet back into a tool holder. We measure the accuracy of the socket-bolt mating subtask over multiple demonstrations and show that a small set of demonstrations can decrease the error significantly.},

  abstract     = {Designing reward functions for efficiently guiding reinforcement learning (RL) agents toward specific behaviors is a complex task. This is challenging since it requires the identification of reward structures that are not sparse and that avoid inadvertently inducing undesirable behaviors. Naively modifying the reward structure to offer denser and more frequent feedback can lead to unintended outcomes and promote behaviors that are not aligned with the designer's intended goal. Although potential-based reward shaping is often suggested as a remedy, we systematically investigate settings where deploying it often significantly impairs performance. To address these issues, we introduce a new framework that uses a bi-level objective to learn \emph{behavior alignment reward functions}. These functions integrate auxiliary rewards reflecting a designer's heuristics and domain knowledge with the environment's primary rewards. Our approach automatically determines the most effective way to blend these types of feedback, thereby enhancing robustness against heuristic reward misspecification. Remarkably, it can also adapt an agent's policy optimization process to mitigate suboptimalities resulting from limitations and biases inherent in the underlying RL algorithms. We evaluate our method's efficacy on a diverse set of tasks, from small-scale experiments to high-dimensional control challenges. We investigate heuristic auxiliary rewards of varying quality -- some of which are beneficial and others detrimental to the learning process. Our results show that our framework offers a robust and principled way to integrate designer-specified heuristics. It not only addresses key shortcomings of existing approaches but also consistently leads to high-performing solutions, even when given misaligned or poorly-specified auxiliary reward functions. },

First, we delve into the nuances of eligibility traces and explore instances where their updates may result in unexpected credit assignment to preceding states. From this investigation emerges the concept of a novel value function, which we refer to as the \emph{bidirectional value function}. Unlike traditional state value functions, bidirectional value functions account for both future expected returns (rewards anticipated from the current state onward) and past expected returns (cumulative rewards from the episode's start to the present). We derive principled update equations to learn this value function and, through experimentation, demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing the process of policy evaluation. In particular, our results indicate that the proposed learning approach can, in certain challenging contexts, perform policy evaluation more rapidly than TD(Î») -- a method that learns forward value functions, vÏ€, \emph{directly}. Overall, our findings present a new perspective on eligibility traces and potential advantages associated with the novel value function it inspires, especially for policy evaluation. },
